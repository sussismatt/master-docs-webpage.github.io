<p> Thousands of Muslims prayed, enjoyed food and music, and attended lectures on Islam this weekend at an annual convention hosted by the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). </p>
<p>
The 54th Annual ISNA Convention was held at the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center in Rosemont. Despite a backdrop of rising anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S., the mood inside was one of cheerfulness and family fun, a number of attendees said.
</p>
<p>
The convention’s headline musical performer was Muslim-Canadian rap duo Deen Squad. The duo’s blending of classic hip-hop beats with lyrics about Islam helps to give Muslims relatable and affirmative music that is not what they normally hear on the radio, explained Deen Squad manager Sami Abboud. 
</p>

<p>
“Our music helps with the identity crisis felt by many young Muslims in the West,” said Abboud. 
</p>
<p>
Attendees listened to the musical performances while enjoying an array of Asian and African dishes. Local vendors served meals in the main dining hall, which was lined with cafeteria-style long tables. For many vendors, such as Heaven’s Honey founder Abdullah Motiwala, the convention remains a fixture of their year. 
</p>
<p>
“We’ve been travelling to this for as many years as I can remember,” said Motiwala. “It’s a tradition.”  
</p>
<p>
Beyond food and entertainment, the convention hosted a variety of lectures during the day, including “Lessons on Mercy and Justice in Islam”, “Saving Rohingya Muslims” and “The Prophet (PBUH) and the Jews”. The lectures featured a variety of well-known speakers, many of whom addressed issues of Muslim-American identity. One such speaker was Palestinian-American activist Linda Sarsour.  
</p>
<p>
“In this country, dissent is the highest form of patriotism,” Sarsour said in her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0tr0CFik2k">keynote address.</a> “Our heroes, the people we say inspire us, whether it be Malcolm X or Muhammad Ali, these are people that dissented against the government and against the policies that oppressed them.”

Other speakers included comedian Dean Obeidallah, former NFL player Ryan Harris, and Islamic scholar Yasir Qadhi. The speakers managed to inspire the audience and contribute to an overall successful weekend, according to organizers.
</p>
<p>
“The convention was a success,” said ISNA communications coordinator Faryal Khatri. “The energy was incredible all weekend.”
</p>
<p>
 While next year’s agenda has not yet been announced, the 55th Annual ISNA Convention is scheduled for early September 2018 in Houston.
